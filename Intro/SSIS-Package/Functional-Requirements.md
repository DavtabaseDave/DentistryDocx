# Functional Requirements

- In order to prevent have to update the entire package at the start of each new academic year
Project Level parameters **MUST** be used so that they can easily be altered
- As there is a slight chance that another Faculty will want a similar DB and variables and other
names object should clearly indicate by a prefix (*"Dent"*) that they are Faculty specific
- At the same time should prefer Project parameterss to Package variables as these can sometimes
 be ineffective due to accidental name collisions etc..
