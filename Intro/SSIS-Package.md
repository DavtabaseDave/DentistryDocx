[[_TOC_]]

There is currently only a single DTSX package - Dntl_Ad_INB_Extractions.dtsx. This has the sole object of extracting data from the Banner Oracle DB, cleaning it up and merging it with the current Dental Admissions DB data tables: applicants, Decision, and A2L Running Record (A2L_RR) data.
